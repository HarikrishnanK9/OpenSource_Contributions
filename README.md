### AgentOps-AI

- ðŸ”§ [**agentops**](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/pull/1150):
  Fixed compatibility issue with Numba by exposing `print_logger` at the module level in `agentops.logging.instrument_logging`, ensuring it can be resolved via `getattr()` without affecting existing logging behavior.

## Academic Projects

### [Health Profile Analysis](https://github.com/HarikrishnanK9/Health_Profile_Analysis)

This project analyzes individual health dataâ€”such as vitals, lifestyle habits, and lab resultsâ€”to generate personalized health insights and recommendations. It empowers users,doctors and medical researchers to make informed wellness decisions through data-driven analysis.

### [Pneumonia Detection, Medical Records Management, and Automated Result Notification System](https://github.com/HarikrishnanK9/Pneumonia-Detection-Medical-Records-Management-and-Automated-Result-Notification-System)  

This project leverages deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images while managing medical records efficiently. It also automates patient result notifications, improving healthcare workflows and reducing manual effort.  


### [Tomato Leaf Disease Detection](https://github.com/HarikrishnanK9/Tomato_Leaf_Disease_Detection)  

This project uses computer vision and deep learning to detect diseases in tomato leaves from image data, helping farmers and agronomists quickly spot crop health issues. It streamlines early disease diagnosis for more effective plant care interventions.  

### [Spam Email Detection](https://github.com/HarikrishnanK9/Spam_Email_Detection)

This project employs machine learning techniques to identify spam emails by analyzing text features and patterns. It enhances email management by automatically classifying messages and reducing unwanted interactions.

### [Global Superstore Power BI Dashboard](https://github.com/HarikrishnanK9/Dashboards/blob/main/Screenshot%20(42).png)

This Power BI dashboard delivers a comprehensive 360-degree sales performance overview from the Global Superstore dataset. It visualizes key metricsâ€”like sales by region, category, and customer segmentsâ€”to support data-driven decision-making with clear and interactive insights.
